## Project Fletcher

##### Back story:

Using data we scrape from the web, what can we learn about our data via unsupervised learning techniques?

##### Data:

 * **type**: text data
 * **acquisition**: api's, scraping, etc.
 * **storage**: mongodb

##### Skills:

   * unsupervised learning
   * topic modeling
   * mongodb
   * nlp
   * dimensionality reduction

### Project Workflow

For project 4, I focused on topic modeling Science (not the topic but one of the world's
leading scientific journals). Science is unique in that it covers all scientific disciplines
and I therefore wanted to use topic modeling to see if articles have overarching themes or topics and, if so, can we monitor how these trend over time.

For this unsupervised learning project, data from the web was used and the code (in the code folder)
should be looked at in the following order (with any modules in the module subfolder):

1. Part_1_Populating_MongoDB.ipynb
2. Part_2_Topic_Modeling_2016.ipynb
3. Part_3_Topic_Modeling_2017.ipynb
4. Part_4_Topic_Modeling_15years.ipynb

Finally, a final presentation on the project can be found in the main presentation folder!
